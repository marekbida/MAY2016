                    <h3><span class="flaticon-interface"></span>  Organisational Abilities</h3>
                    <p>I have learned the importance of prioritising work load and ensuring that deadlines are met when studying full time at North East Scotland College and working part time. This was recognized when awarded the highest grades (A) in both: Graded Unit Project & Graded Unit Exam.</p>
                    <h3><span class="flaticon-interface"></span>  Commitment & Motivation</h3>
                    <p>Skills have been developed and enriched by carrying out independent research for start-up company (Ramari Ltd) when working to a deadline, and the overall management of workload throughout college. I had a chance to lead the small team to prepare the office environment (this included the advice & purchase of IT equipment). I ensured to deliver the best possible solution to the company’s needs & financial abilities. Until today I am voluntarily supporting the company in resolving various types of computer issues, both: hardware and software.</p>
                    <h3><span class="flaticon-interface"></span>  Problem solving and Analysis</h3>
                    <p>I had an opportunity to support a number of individuals in Poland and UK when finding the cost effective solutions to fix the hardware issues of various devices (mainly laptops and PC’s).
                        Through brainstorming ideas and analysis with team members I have always completed all projects (at college, university and at work) on time and in budget constraints.</p>
                    <h3><span class="flaticon-interface"></span>  Flexibility & Adaptability</h3>
                    <p>During my career I had a chance to work with different people in terms of their age, personality, nationality and culture/religion. What I have learned is how to listen to people and how to learn from their experience. My flexibility allows for the friendly atmosphere during the projects - I can easily adapt to busy environments and perform well when working under the pressure.</p>
                    <h3><span class="flaticon-interface"></span>  Teamwork & Leadership</h3>
                    <p>Best place to gain the above skills and attributes is… on the deck of the sailboat. Working together with a different types of people in a challenging environment, not only builds confidence but also helps to learn how to deal with extreme situations. I learned how to sail in July 2002 and since then I faced many challenges – not only as a part of the crew, but most recently as a captain as well. I have organized a number of sailboat cruises and successfully delivered training to people within different age range and experience. I strongly believe that once I gain experience and knowledge to become confident within IT industry, I will undoubtedly use my skills to support the rest of the team and the company.</p>
